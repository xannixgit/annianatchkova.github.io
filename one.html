        <button onclick="toggleDetails('france-details')">View Details</button>
        <div id ="france-details" style ="display: none;">

            <p>
                France may be synonymous with luxury, but it’s also a paradise for budget travelers who want to soak up its charm without overspending.
                In Paris, take a leisurely stroll through Montmartre, where cobblestone streets lead to quaint cafes and stunning views from the Sacré-Cœur.
                For a relaxing evening, grab a baguette and some cheese and enjoy a sunset picnic by the Seine—it’s as romantic as it is affordable.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                If you venture beyond the capital, France’s diverse regions promise unique experiences. In Lyon, the gastronomic heart of the country, 
                explore its UNESCO-listed Old Town and feast on local delicacies without breaking the bank. For those craving nature, the lavender fields 
                of Provence offer a magical escape that’s perfect for travelers looking to unplug and unwind.
            </p>

            <p>

        <h2>Italy</h2>

        <div id="italy-details" style="display: none;">

            <p>
                Italy is a dream destination for travelers seeking history, culture and mouthwatering cuisine - all without emptying their wallets.
                Begin your journey in Rome, where ancient landamarks like the Colosseum and Roman Forum offer a glimpse into the glory of the past.
                Many of these sites can be enjoyed for free or at minimal cost with city passes.
            </p>

            <p>
                For a romantic escape, Venice is a must-visit. Wandering through its winding streets and cross iconic bridges like the Rialto.
                While gondola rides can be pricey, exploring the city by foot or vaporetto (water bus) offers just as much magic for a fraction of the cost.
            </p>

            <p>
                And don't forget Florence, the birthplace of the Renaissance. Many of its art-filled piazzas and stunning views, like the one from Piazzale Michelangelo, are completely free to enjoy.
                With affordable hostels and a world-renowned food scene, Italy proves you don't need a royal budget to live "la dolce vita."
