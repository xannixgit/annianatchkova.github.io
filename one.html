        <div id="germany-details" style="display: none;">

            <p>
                Germany is a country that seamlessly blends history, culture, and natural beauty - all within a budget-friendly package.
                Start your journey in Berlin, where the echoes of the past come alive at landmarks like the Berlin Wall Memorial and Brandenburg Gate.
                These iconic sites are not only free to visit but also provide insights into Germany's modern history.
            </p>

            <p>
                For nature lovers, the Black Forest awaits with its fairy-tale charm. Imagine hiking through lush trails that inspired the Brothers Grimm,
                or exploring picturesque villages nestled in the hills. Munich, on the other hand, offers a laid-back Bavarian vibe with plenty of
                free and affordable attractions. Don't miss the sprawling English Garden, a perfect spot for a leisurly afternoon.
            </p>

            <p>
            Whether you’re hopping between cities with the Deutschland-Ticket or staying in cozy hostels starting at just €20 a night, Germany offers 
            an incredible adventure for budget-conscious travelers.

        <h2>France</h2>
        <img src="lien-van-win-LkGBuGrFMug-unsplash.jpg" alt="Cassis beach with turquoise water and cliffs" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; border-radius: 8px;">
        <button onclick="toggleDetails('france-details')">View Details</button>
        <div id ="france-details" style ="display: none;">

            <p>
                France may be synonymous with luxury, but it’s also a paradise for budget travelers who want to soak up its charm without overspending.
                In Paris, take a leisurely stroll through Montmartre, where cobblestone streets lead to quaint cafes and stunning views from the Sacré-Cœur.
                For a relaxing evening, grab a baguette and some cheese and enjoy a sunset picnic by the Seine—it’s as romantic as it is affordable.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                If you venture beyond the capital, France’s diverse regions promise unique experiences. In Lyon, the gastronomic heart of the country, 
                explore its UNESCO-listed Old Town and feast on local delicacies without breaking the bank. For those craving nature, the lavender fields 
                of Provence offer a magical escape that’s perfect for travelers looking to unplug and unwind.
            </p>

            <p>
             With affordable hostels starting at €25 a night and free museum entry on select days, France is proof that the finer things in life
             don't have to come with a hefty price tag.

        <h2>Italy</h2>
        <img src="photoholgic-0e3nDftJlhw-unsplash.jpg" alt="Countryside in Tuscany, Italy" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; border-radius: 8px;">
        <button onclick="toggleDetails('italy-details')">View Details</button>
        <div id="italy-details" style="display: none;">

            <p>
                Italy is a dream destination for travelers seeking history, culture and mouthwatering cuisine - all without emptying their wallets.
                Begin your journey in Rome, where ancient landamarks like the Colosseum and Roman Forum offer a glimpse into the glory of the past.
                Many of these sites can be enjoyed for free or at minimal cost with city passes.
            </p>

            <p>
                For a romantic escape, Venice is a must-visit. Wandering through its winding streets and cross iconic bridges like the Rialto.
                While gondola rides can be pricey, exploring the city by foot or vaporetto (water bus) offers just as much magic for a fraction of the cost.
            </p>

            <p>
                And don't forget Florence, the birthplace of the Renaissance. Many of its art-filled piazzas and stunning views, like the one from Piazzale Michelangelo, are completely free to enjoy.
                With affordable hostels and a world-renowned food scene, Italy proves you don't need a royal budget to live "la dolce vita."
